# Pure HTML Project

### The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML structure and elements.

The repository named Project is a simple, static website built using only HTML. No CSS or JavaScript is used. Apart from that, all the other files contain most of the tags (including some underrated such as picture, fieldset, bdo, etc.) with proper demonstration.

### Perfect mix of Demo+Notes+Project of:

* Simple HTML projects with source code.
* HTML for beginners to advance (Literally!)
* Getting introduced to some underrated and quite useful tags.
* Unique HTML project ideas.
* Or project to practice.
## Getting Started

#### Since this is an example project, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use for your own purposes. It's a good starter boilerplate.

* Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
* Open the index.html file of the Project directory in your preferred browser to view the website.
* Explore the code by opening the file in a text editor and following the comments.
